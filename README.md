This repo started as an OpenWrt firmware storage for one device, but now has these firmwares:
- Airpi AP3000M / Hiveton H5000M
- CMCC RAX3000M/Me
- Cudy TR3000 128/256/512 mb
- Cudy WBR3000UAX
- gl.inet GL-MT3000 (Beryl AX)
- Huasifei WH3000 / WH3000 Pro
- Xiaomi AX3000T

Also, I am becoming addicted to ImmortalWrt firmwares from [PadavanOnly](https://github.com/padavanonly/immortalwrt-mt798x-6.6) because of a powerful proprietary Mediatek wifi drivers. Check the folder.
