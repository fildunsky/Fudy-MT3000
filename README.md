This repo started as an OpenWrt firmware storage for one device, but now has these firmwares:
- CMCC RAX3000Me Nand USB (ImmortalWrt U-boot)
- Cudy TR3000 v1 (OpenWrt U-Boot layout) 128mb router version with 93mb free for userspace
- Cudy TR3000 256mb v1
- Huasifei WH3000
- Huasifei WH3000 Pro

Also, I am becoming addicted to ImmortalWrt firmwares from [PadavanOnly](https://github.com/padavanonly/immortalwrt-mt798x-6.6) because of proprietary Mediatek wifi drivers. Check the folder.
