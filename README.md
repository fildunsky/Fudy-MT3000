This repo started as an OpenWrt firmware storage for one device, but now has these firmwares:
- CMCC RAX3000M/Me
- Cudy TR3000 128/256 mb
- Huasifei WH3000 / WH3000 Pro
- Xiaomi AX3000T

Also, I am becoming addicted to ImmortalWrt firmwares from [PadavanOnly](https://github.com/padavanonly/immortalwrt-mt798x-6.6) because of powerful proprietary Mediatek wifi drivers. Check the folder.
